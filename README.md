  - Content: This project will do a within-country analysis for COVID cases and the relationship with demographics, economics etc. Ideally we share the same methodology across counrtries, with sub-teams working per country.

    - USA: [COVID](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
 
- There is also a lot of detailed data on health, demographics, economics etc at Eurostat we should exploit.
- In general, we are looking for COVID, demographics, life tables, cause of death, economics, health care etc.
 
## 3. COVID spread and pollution relationship
  - Contributors: [Sofia Amaral-Garcia](https://github.com/samaralgarcia) and [Ilaria Natali](https://github.com/Ilaria0205).
  - Content: This project will focus on the relationship between indicators of the quality of air/pollution levels and the   spread of CODIV-19. The goal is to find out whether, and to what extent, pollution can act as a ‘vector’, facilitating transmission and allowing the virus to spread quickly. Ideally, the project will exploit variation in indicators of the quality of air and the number of CODIV-19 cases across regions within the same country and across European counties.”
